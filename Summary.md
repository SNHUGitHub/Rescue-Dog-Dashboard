# Summary of Milestone

This is the last milestone for the full stack software application project that we developed for our client, Grazioso Salvare. We completed the back-end development with the CRUD Python Module milestone at an earlier stage in the development process. This milestone imports the CRUD Python Module into a client-facing web application dashboard that allows our client to work with data imported from the Austin Animal Centerâ€™s database (AAC).
