# About

This project is a full stack software application for our client, Grazioso Salvare. The development includes two milestones:
1) Milestone #1 is creating a Python module with CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) functionalities that can connect a database and client-facing web application dashboard. The CRUD Python module allows our client to manipulate rescue animal data that are imported from the Austin Animal Centerâ€™s database (AAC). The AAC is a non-profit agency that is working with our client.
2) Milestone #2 imports the CRUD Python Module into a client-facing web application dashboard that includes dynamic filtering options, enabling efficient data manipulation and display for the animal rescue data.
