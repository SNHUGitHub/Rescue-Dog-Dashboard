# About

This project is a full stack software application for our client, Grazioso Salvare. The full stack development includes creating a Python module with CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) functionalities that can connect the database and client-facing web application dashboard that we will create for our client. The purpose of the CRUD Python module is to allow our client to manipulate the animal data that is imported from the Austin Animal Centerâ€™s database (AAC). The AAC is a non-profit agency that is working with our client.
