# About

This milestone includes a Python module with CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) functionalities that can connect the database and client-facing web application dashboard that we created for our client in the next milestone. The purpose of the CRUD Python module is to allow our client to manipulate the animal data that is imported from the Austin Animal Centerâ€™s database (AAC). The AAC is a non-profit agency that is working with our client.
